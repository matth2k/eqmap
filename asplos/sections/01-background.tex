% Formal Properties of E-Graphs

% Equivalence graphs (e-graphs) are a data structure that were originally
% conceived to facilitate automated proof generation~\cite{eggpaper, eqsat}. For
% example, e-graphs can be used to simplify mathematical
% expressions~\cite{egraphmath} or for automated reasoning about functional
% programs~\cite{cclemma}.
