\subsection{E-Graph Superoptimization}\label{sec:relatedwork:egraph}
Equivalence graphs---e-graphs for short---are a data structure that were
originally conceived to facilitate automated proof generation. For example,
e-graphs can be used to simplify mathematical expressions~\cite{egraphmath} and
\todo{what cclemmadoes}~\cite{cclemma}. \todo{explain how EqSat works, why its
    good}. In recent years, e-graphs~\cite{eggpaper} and equality
saturation~\cite{eqsat} have enjoyed renewed popularity within the compilers
field. \todo{compiler examples}
