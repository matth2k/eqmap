\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
For our experiments, we used a Red Hat 8 server with a Intel Xeon Gold 6242
CPU. Since \shortname{} is written in Rust, it mostly uses the built-in
functionality of the egg library. The egg e-graph runner was ran in a
time-limited configuration, meaning there was no limit in the size of the
e-graph or number of rewrite iterations. The specific time limit for e-graph
construction was 10 minutes. In most cases, the test circuit saturated the
e-graph before this time limit. \shortname{} was evaluated against circuits
from three benchmark suites: EPFL~\cite{epflbench}, ISCAS'85~\cite{iscasbench},
and LGSynth'91~\cite{lgsynthbench}. However, we also included an ALU and
pipelined multiplication module to test how our compiler behaves with
increasing levels of bit-parallelism and pipeline stages. Finally, we measure
how our mapping optimizations influence timing closure.

Among the 96 benchmarks we tested, we found that \shortname{} was able to
reduce the LUT count 31\% of the time. On average, \shortname{} packed the
netlists to \metric{}. The results in Table~\ref{tab:results} list the LUT counts \todo{explain table}.
