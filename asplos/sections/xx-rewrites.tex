\subsection{Simplifying Degenerate LUTs} \label{sec:rewrites:degen}

\textbf{Definition:} A lookup table $F : \{ 0, 1 \}^n \rightarrow \{ 0, 1 \}$ is \textit{degenerate} if there is exists a Shannon expansion $F = x_i \cdot F_{x_i} + \overline{x_i} \cdot F_{\overline{x}_i}$
such that $F_{x_i} = F_{\overline{x}_i}$ for some $i \in \{ 0, \ldots, n -1\}$. In other words, $F = F_{x_i} = F_{\overline{x}_i}$.

The output of a degenerate LUT is not dependent on one of its inputs. Hence, it
can be rewritten into a LUT which uses fewer inputs. This rule is applied by
computing the Shannon expansions of LUTs and checking for equivalence.

\begin{verbatim}
    (LUT p x0 x1 x2) => (LUT p' x0 x1)
        if p(x0, x1, 0) == p(x0, x1, 1) always
        where p'(x0, x1) := p(x0, x1, 0)
\end{verbatim}

A separate rule is instantiated for every LUT size and every input position. In
total, $\sum_{i=1}^{6} i = 6(6+1)/2 = 21$ rules are instantiated for searching
for degenerate LUTs. Since this rule is computationally expensive, it is
applied greedily as a pre-processing step before the e-graph is built. None of
the other rewrite rules create degenerate LUTs, so this has no impact on
results. Of course this rule can be enabled at any time, if it were necessary.
