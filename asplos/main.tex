\title{\fullname}

\begin{abstract}
    FPGA technology mapping is a well-studied problem and has been an area of interest in EDA tool design for decades.
    In most respects, the computational complexity of technology mapping is understood, and adequate heuristic algorithms have been sucessfully employed to mitigate compile times while maintaing high QoR (quality of results).
    As transistor scaling comes to an end within the next few years, synthesis tools will become more of the bottleneck in designing high performance accelerators. As a solution, we introduce \shortname{}, an e-graph driven technology mapper that can better span the cavern between SAT-based exact synthesis and heuristic cut enumeration techniques.
    In our experiments, we show that \shortname{} can synthesize circuits with \todo{X\%} fewer LUTs on average, \textit{without ever increasing circuit depth}.
    We also provide an empirical analysis the runtime of \shortname{} and show that it is still practical for large (~10,000 LUT) designs.
    Finally, we demonstrate that our compiler infrastructure is reusable, and future work can use our compiler for RTL equivalence checking or auditing the QoR of synthesis tools.
