\title{\fullname}

\begin{abstract}
    FPGA technology mapping is a well-studied problem and has been an area of
    interest in EDA tool design for decades. In most respects, the computational
    complexity of technology mapping is understood, and heuristic algorithms have
    been successfully employed to mitigate compile times while maintaining high QoR
    (quality of results). As transistor scaling comes to an end within the coming
    years, logic synthesis tools will become more of a bottleneck in the design of
    high performance accelerators. As a solution, we introduce E-Pack, an e-graph
    driven technology mapper that can better span the wide gap between SAT-based
    exact synthesis and heuristic cut enumeration techniques. We show that E-Pack
    can synthesize circuits with 5\% fewer LUTs on average---without ever
    increasing circuit depth. We also provide an empirical analysis of the runtime
    of E-Pack and show that it is still practical for large designs. Finally, we
    demonstrate that our compiler infrastructure is reusable, and future work can
    use our compiler for RTL equivalence checking or auditing the QoR of synthesis
    tools.
