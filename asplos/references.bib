  abstract  = {Logic synthesis plays a crucial role in the digital design flow. It has a decisive influence on the final Quality of Results (QoR) of the circuit implementations. However, existing multi-level logic optimization algorithms often employ greedy approaches with a series of local optimization steps. Each step breaks the circuit into small pieces (e.g.,k-feasible cuts) and applies incremental changes to individual pieces separately. These local optimization steps could limit the exploration space and may miss opportunities for significant improvements. To address the limitation, this paper proposes using e-graph in logic synthesis. The new workflow, named E-Syn, makes use of the well-established e-graph infrastructure to efficiently perform logic rewriting. It explores a diverse set of equivalent Boolean representations while allowing technology-aware cost functions to better support delay-oriented and area-oriented logic synthesis. Experiments over a wide range of benchmark designs show our proposed logic optimization approach reaches a wider design space compared to the commonly used AIG-based logic synthesis flow. It achieves on average 15.29\% delay saving in delay-oriented synthesis and 6.42\% area saving for area-oriented synthesis.},

  abstract   = {One of the main objectives in the process of mapping a digital circuit onto a LUT-based FPGA structure is minimizing the total number of lookup tables needed to implement the circuit. This will increase the size of the circuit that can be implemented using the available FPGA structure. In this paper, we show that even restricted cases of the lookup-table minimization for FPGA technology mapping are NP-complete (even when K is a small constant), and that it can be solved optimally for all values of K on a tree input in O(min{nK, nlogn}) time where n is the number of nodes in the network and K is the input capacity of the LUT's. Based on our algorithm for trees, we present a polynomial time heuristic algorithm for general Boolean networks. Experimental results confirm substantial decrease on the number of LUT's on a number of MCNC logic synthesis benchmarks compared to the algorithms that allow no or just local exploitation of Boolean properties of the circuit. We obtain 10\% to 80\% improvement on the number of LUT's compared to the previous algorithms (even though we allow very limited operations, e.g., we do not exploit Boolean properties of the circuits or decompose nodes)},

  abstract  = {Most existing technology mapping algorithms use graph covering approaches and suffer from the netlist structural bias problem. Chen and Cong proposed a simultaneous simple gate decomposition with technology mapping algorithm that encodes many gate decomposition choices into the netlist. However, their algorithm suffers from the long runtime problem due to a large set of choices. Later on, A. Mishchenko et al. proposed a mapping algorithm based on choice generation with the so-called lossless synthesis. Nevertheless, their algorithm cannot guarantee to find and keep all good choices a priori before mapping. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous mapping with gate decomposition algorithm named AGDMap. Our algorithm uses cut-enumeration based engine. Bin packing algorithm is used for simple gate decomposition during cut enumeration. Input sharing based cut cost computation is used during iterative cut selection for logic duplication reduction. Based on a set of EPFL benchmark suite and HLS generated designs, our algorithm produces results with significant area improvement. Compared with the lossless synthesis algorithm, for area optimization, our average improvement is 12.4\%. For delay optimization, we get results with similar delay and 9.2\% area reduction.},

  abstract  = {Most FPGA technology mapping approaches either target Lookup Tables (LUTs) or relatively simple Programmable Logic Blocks (PLBs). Considering networks of PLBs during technology mapping has the potential of providing unique optimizations unavailable through other techniques. This paper proposes a Boolean matching approach for FPGA technology mapping targeting networks of PLBs. To overcome the demanding memory requirements of previous approaches, the Boolean matching problem is formulated as a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Since the SAT formulation provides a trade-off between space and time, the primary objective is to increase the efficiency of the SAT-based approach. To do this, the original SAT problem is decomposed into two easier SAT problems. To reduce the problem search space, a theorem is introduced to allow conflict clauses to be shared across problems and extra constraints are generated. Experiments demonstrate a 340\% run time improvement and 27\% more success in mapping than previous SAT-based approaches.},

  abstract   = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites. This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation. We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},

  abstract  = {E-graphs have gained increasing popularity in compiler optimization, program synthesis, and theorem proving tasks. They enable compact representation of many equivalent expressions and facilitate transformations via rewrite rules without phase ordering limitations. A major benefit of using e-graphs is the ability to explore a large space of equivalent expressions, allowing the extraction of an expression that best meets certain optimization objectives (or cost models). However, current e-graph extraction methods often face unfavorable scalability-quality trade-offs and only support simple linear cost functions, limiting their applicability to more realistic optimization problems.In this work, we propose SmoothE, a differentiable e-graph extraction algorithm designed to handle complex cost models and optimized for GPU acceleration. More specifically, we approach the e-graph extraction problem from a probabilistic perspective, where the original discrete optimization is relaxed to a continuous differentiable form. This formulation supports any differentiable cost functions and enables efficient searching for solutions using gradient descent. We implement SmoothE in PyTorch to leverage the advancements of the modern machine learning ecosystem. Additionally, we introduce performance optimization techniques to exploit sparsity and data parallelism. We evaluate SmoothE on a variety of realistic e-graphs from five different applications using three distinct cost models, including both linear and non-linear ones. Our experiments demonstrate that SmoothE consistently achieves a favorable trade-off between scalability and solution quality.},
