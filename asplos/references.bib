  abstract  = {This paper presents an enhanced version of a scalable HLS (High-Level Synthesis) framework named ScaleHLS, which can compile HLS C/C++ programs and PyTorch models to highly-efficient and synthesizable C++ designs. The original version of ScaleHLS achieved significant speedup on both C/C++ kernels and PyTorch models [14]. In this paper, we first highlight the key features of ScaleHLS on tackling the challenges present in the representation, optimization, and exploration of large-scale HLS designs. To further improve the scalability of ScaleHLS, we then propose an enhanced HLS transform and analysis library supported in both C++ and Python, and a new design space exploration algorithm to handle HLS designs with hierarchical structures more effectively. Comparing to the original ScaleHLS, our enhanced version improves the speedup by up to 60.9\texttimes{} on FPGAs. ScaleHLS is fully open-sourced at https://github.com/hanchenye/scalehls.},
