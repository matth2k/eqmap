  abstract  = {Logic synthesis plays a crucial role in the digital design flow. It has a decisive influence on the final Quality of Results (QoR) of the circuit implementations. However, existing multi-level logic optimization algorithms often employ greedy approaches with a series of local optimization steps. Each step breaks the circuit into small pieces (e.g.,k-feasible cuts) and applies incremental changes to individual pieces separately. These local optimization steps could limit the exploration space and may miss opportunities for significant improvements. To address the limitation, this paper proposes using e-graph in logic synthesis. The new workflow, named E-Syn, makes use of the well-established e-graph infrastructure to efficiently perform logic rewriting. It explores a diverse set of equivalent Boolean representations while allowing technology-aware cost functions to better support delay-oriented and area-oriented logic synthesis. Experiments over a wide range of benchmark designs show our proposed logic optimization approach reaches a wider design space compared to the commonly used AIG-based logic synthesis flow. It achieves on average 15.29\% delay saving in delay-oriented synthesis and 6.42\% area saving for area-oriented synthesis.},

  abstract   = {One of the main objectives in the process of mapping a digital circuit onto a LUT-based FPGA structure is minimizing the total number of lookup tables needed to implement the circuit. This will increase the size of the circuit that can be implemented using the available FPGA structure. In this paper, we show that even restricted cases of the lookup-table minimization for FPGA technology mapping are NP-complete (even when K is a small constant), and that it can be solved optimally for all values of K on a tree input in O(min{nK, nlogn}) time where n is the number of nodes in the network and K is the input capacity of the LUT's. Based on our algorithm for trees, we present a polynomial time heuristic algorithm for general Boolean networks. Experimental results confirm substantial decrease on the number of LUT's on a number of MCNC logic synthesis benchmarks compared to the algorithms that allow no or just local exploitation of Boolean properties of the circuit. We obtain 10\% to 80\% improvement on the number of LUT's compared to the previous algorithms (even though we allow very limited operations, e.g., we do not exploit Boolean properties of the circuits or decompose nodes)},

  abstract  = {Most existing technology mapping algorithms use graph covering approaches and suffer from the netlist structural bias problem. Chen and Cong proposed a simultaneous simple gate decomposition with technology mapping algorithm that encodes many gate decomposition choices into the netlist. However, their algorithm suffers from the long runtime problem due to a large set of choices. Later on, A. Mishchenko et al. proposed a mapping algorithm based on choice generation with the so-called lossless synthesis. Nevertheless, their algorithm cannot guarantee to find and keep all good choices a priori before mapping. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous mapping with gate decomposition algorithm named AGDMap. Our algorithm uses cut-enumeration based engine. Bin packing algorithm is used for simple gate decomposition during cut enumeration. Input sharing based cut cost computation is used during iterative cut selection for logic duplication reduction. Based on a set of EPFL benchmark suite and HLS generated designs, our algorithm produces results with significant area improvement. Compared with the lossless synthesis algorithm, for area optimization, our average improvement is 12.4\%. For delay optimization, we get results with similar delay and 9.2\% area reduction.},

  abstract  = {Most FPGA technology mapping approaches either target Lookup Tables (LUTs) or relatively simple Programmable Logic Blocks (PLBs). Considering networks of PLBs during technology mapping has the potential of providing unique optimizations unavailable through other techniques. This paper proposes a Boolean matching approach for FPGA technology mapping targeting networks of PLBs. To overcome the demanding memory requirements of previous approaches, the Boolean matching problem is formulated as a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. Since the SAT formulation provides a trade-off between space and time, the primary objective is to increase the efficiency of the SAT-based approach. To do this, the original SAT problem is decomposed into two easier SAT problems. To reduce the problem search space, a theorem is introduced to allow conflict clauses to be shared across problems and extra constraints are generated. Experiments demonstrate a 340\% run time improvement and 27\% more success in mapping than previous SAT-based approaches.},
